## PROJECT
---

A remake of the University of Ghana school website.
The main purpose of this project is to modify but __not change__ the University's prestigious website.
It is evident that the website lacks a few design elements thus our choice to redesign the website. We also aim at improving
the user experience and interaction on the website.



## OBJECTIVE
---
To achieve a well-designed and easily navigable website with better user experience and quick access to relevant information.

We don't intend to fix or get them to use this project for the real website but this is how we envision the website to look like. (As well as the MIS WEB INTERFACE for the school)
