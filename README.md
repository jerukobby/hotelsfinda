## Documentation
The main purpose is to revamp but __not change__ the Universities prestigious website.
IT is evident that the website lacks a few design elements thus our choice to redesign the website. To improve
the experience users have on the website and to engage people.

## Project
---
This is the remake of the university of Ghana website by hard coding all the pages together using bootstrap. 

## Goal
---
To achieve a well designed easy to navigate website with better experience and quick access to relevant more information.

This is a website we are doing for our university. We dont intent to fix or get them to use this project for the real website but this is how we envision the website to look like. (As well as MIS WEB INTERFACE FOR THE SCHOOL)
